      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        The Barbary Coast Cloggers, a San Francisco-based Appalachian clogging
        and folk dance team, approached us to overhaul their outdated website.
        The primary objectives were to correct outdated information, integrate
        new photos and videos, and give the site a contemporary look that aligns
        with the dynamic spirit of the dance team.

      <h2>Issues/Problems</h2>
      <p>
        One significant challenge was the lack of clear direction at the
        project's outset. This necessitated a lot of independent research and
        creative freedom. Additionally, sourcing up-to-date media required
        reaching out to various team members and combing through different
        platforms like YouTube.
      </p>
      <h2>Process/Action/Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        Given the minimal constraints, I began by researching other dance
        websites for inspiration. I developed a simple wireframe to organize
        content placement and then proceeded with the design using HTML and CSS.
        The process involved: Creating a visual layout that reflected the
        group's vibrant energy. Integrating new media, including photos and
        embedded YouTube videos. Developing essential pages such as About, Class
        Information, Media, and Contact Us.
      </p>
      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>
        The redesigned website was well-received by the Barbary Coast Cloggers.
        They appreciated the modernized color scheme and updated fonts, which
        better reflected their identity. However, the initial design did not
        include mobile responsiveness, which is a planned future improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <h4>Multi-page Design:</h4>
      <p>
        Added comprehensive pages including Home, Class Information, Upcoming
        Events, Gallery with photos and video links, Cue Sheets, and Contact Us.
      </p>
      <h4>Media Integration:</h4>
      <p>

        activities.

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>
        The client was pleased with the overall redesign, noting the improved
        aesthetic and functionality. Moving forward, the website will require
        updates to accommodate new content as the group continues to perform and
        evolve. Additionally, making the site responsive for mobile users is a
        priority for the next phase of the project.
