        <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          Please feel free to browse my online portfolio, which includes links
          to my past projects, my current resume, and ways to connect with me.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As I transition from a career in healthcare to the world of web
          design, I’m driven by a passion for creating 'something from nothing'
          and the opportunity to craft engaging user experiences. Web design
          offers a unique blend of creativity and problem-solving that resonates
          with my desire for a career that balances work and life while allowing
          me to innovate and express myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m drawn to the autonomy that comes with front-end design—having the
          freedom to bring my ideas to life while collaborating with others
          under some guidance. The values of the web design community, such as
          open-source collaboration and the communal support for solving coding
          challenges, are aspects I deeply admire. I thrive in environments
          where creativity is celebrated and where there’s a shared commitment
          to helping each other succeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m excited about the possibilities this new path holds and eager to
          contribute to a team where my skills and enthusiasm for design can
          make a meaningful impact.
